# Glass-Rewrite
A Rewrite of a Garrys Mod Addon created a year ago

Currently Features:
-Networked shards
-Custom collision
-Ability to set color/material of shards
-Completely procedural
-(Mostly) lag friendly, unfortunately can't do much about laggy source vphysics

Features needed to be added:
-Network shard data to incoming clients
-Hopefully some vphysics hackery I can do to improve performance with large shard piles
-Different break patterns
-Tool to turn things to glass
-Cool refractive glass material
-(Dupe support?)
